"1. Statistics are shown for the state in which the newly acquired, established, or expanded U.S. business enterprise is located. If the U.S. business enterprise operates in more than one state; it is the state where the largest number of employees are based; if there are no employees it is the state of incorporation of the U.S. business enterprise."
2. First-year expenditures include expenditures in the year in which the transaction occurred.
"3. Planned total expenditures include first-year expenditures for all investments plus planned future expenditures until completion (and expenditures from past years, if any) for establishments and expansions that are multiyear investments. For acquired U.S. businesses, first-year expenditures and planned total expenditures are the same."
"4. ""Other U.S. areas"" consists of the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and all other outlying U.S. areas."
5. For U.S. business enterprises with transaction costs below $3 million information on the state of location was not collected prior to 2017.
